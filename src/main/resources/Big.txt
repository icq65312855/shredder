The timestamp must be greater that the cue's start timestamp,
greater than any previous timestamp in the cue payload,
and less than the cue's end timestamp. The active text is
the text between the timestamp and the next timestamp or
to the end of the payload if there is not another timestamp
in the payload. Any text before the active text in the payload
is previous text . Any text beyond the active text is future text .
